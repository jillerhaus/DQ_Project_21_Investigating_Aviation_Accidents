# DataQuest Project 21: Investigating Aviation Accidents with Different Sorting Algorithms

This is the 21st project I completed in the "Data Analyst in Python" and "Data Scientist in Python" paths from Dataquest. In this project different sorting algorithms were constructed in order to sort and analyze a dataset of aviation accidents.

The educational goal of the project was to learn how the computational expense of different algorithms can impact a project and how to construct better, more efficient algorithms using recursion.

## Prerequisites

This project requires only the Jupyter notebook containing the completed project, as well as the `TXT` file containing the data on the aviation accidents.

To run this project, you will need `Jupyter Notebooks` with a python 3 kernel to be installed on your machine. Instructions on how to install `Jupyter Notebooks` can be found on the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install).

The project itself is written in Python 3 and uses the modules `Numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`,  and `Pandas`,  to run. These can be installed by running `pip install <name of module>` in the console.
